## Flat Simulation
This simulation takes place on a flat plain with homogeneous fuels (fuel type 3 (Tall grass)) in this case. This wind profile is constant at 2m/s and the simulation is run in a one-way coupled (fire_atm_feedback = 0) mode. 

To change where the fire propagates, modify the input_sounding profile to the desired wind and wind direction. For information on input_soundings, please visit: https://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0631741/wrf-sfire/WRF_Sfire_in_ideal_cases.pdf slide 5.
