## Rain

This simulation takes place on a plain with a hill in the domain. The fuels are homogeneous (fuel type 3 (Tall grass)). In this case, there is rain in the simulation. 

This simulation should use ~16 cores. Any more or any less will likely result in a crash. This simulation should take around 10 minutes to run (depending on the cluster used and the CPU's).
