## Two Fires

This simulation takes place on a flat plain with homogeneous fuels (fuel type 3 (Tall grass)). There are two fires in this simulation with each ignition staggered. 

This simulation should be run using 32-36 cores. Anything greater or less than this will likely cause a break. It should take around 15 minutes (depending on the cluster and CPU used).
