## fireflux_small

This simulations occurrs on flat ground with a homogeneous fuel (fuel type 3 (Tall grass)). This simulation is much smaller than fireflux_sfc and represents the FireFlux simulation in 2006. 

This simulation should use around 16 cores and will take around 5 minutes to run (depending on cluster and CPU's used).
